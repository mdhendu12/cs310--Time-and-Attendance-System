# cs310 -- Time and Attendance System

Our scrum team, comprising of three developers and a scrummaster, were tasked with creating a 'Time and Attendance System' for our semester long project. We implemented a functional backend API for a piece of hardware that kept track of various employees, their shifts, and when they punched in or out.
